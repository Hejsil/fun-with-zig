# fun-with-zig

`fun-with-zig` is a Zig library full of random utilities.

## Why?

The project started as just me playing with the features of the Zig language and its features in
unconventional ways. This then lead to a few utilites that where actually useful as libraries.

Now, this repo works by first playing with something in the `fun` directory. Nothing in that directory
is actually useful, as files might just play around with the oddities of Zig, or the file might be
just an idea with no user friendly api.

If something in `fun` then turns into anything useful, it'll be moved to `src` and an effort will
be made to finish up the idea, testing it, and providing a nice api.

Files from `src` might even be moved into its own repo if the ideas a file or files explore
become bigger standalone concepts.
